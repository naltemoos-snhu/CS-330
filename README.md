How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software starts with taking the time to map out and understand the requirements so I can plan effeciently and keep in mind what the functionality of the project is suppose to be as I develop the software. I also like to keep the code modular and organized for reusability and readability.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
The project helped me develop skills when it came to scene management and keeping things organized and modular and iterating the design and testing along the way to make sure that it was still functioning the way I needed it to and that it was changing as intended.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
The main process I followed was analyzing the requirements, protyping with random objects and premade textures and materials and lighting as I figured out how it worked within the environment, and then testing each thing to match a requirement needed.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Soem tactics I can use in the future is the iterative development aspects and reusing components throughout the code.

How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developing software with starting small with functional prototypes and focusing on frequent testing through the iterations.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
The main new strategy used was handling events when it came to user input with the mouse and keyboard.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration factored into my development by being tested as each new object and feature was added along with the milestone progress in each module. 

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approach has evolved through the milestones by incorparating better planning and ensuring my code stayed readable and organized.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science will help my reach goals because it trains me in different mindsets and strategies and problem solving skills that I can apply to many different fields in the future. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics gives me further knowledge in how mathematics and creativity is important and used in our field and that they will be essential to develop as I move along.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Computaional graphics gives me new knowledge in terms of interdisciplinary uses even if I won't directly work withit myself, framing the real world applications of how it's used, and it's a good demonstration in resource management.
